This project went relatively smoothly beyond commiting to GITHUB, all of the HTML coding lessons were learned and absorbed correctly however the 
part that was very unclear to me was how to properly commit files to github to actually get links to work. Skills used 
a href, ol, ul, li, img src, h1, h2, h3, !DOCTYPE, img src, etc. no issues code worked on first run all three times. Added some extras 
including format to give images description and i to highlight the image descripton.
