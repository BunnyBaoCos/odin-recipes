     <h2> Newfoundland Date Squares </h2>

     <img src="recipes/Newfoundland-Date-Squares-bb-532x800.jpg">
     <p> Newfoundland Date Squares are a traditional Newfoundland treat!  Slightly sweet, with a crumb topping, and a soft, chewy center, they are just perfect for an afternoon snack with a cup of hot tea! These are a regular treat on the island; no special occasion is needed!
        This is a "by heart" recipe so measurements are loosely these you feel looks right! 
     </p>
     
     <h3> INGREDIENTS </h3>
     
        <h4> FILLING </h4>
        <ul> 
        <li> 2 1/4 cups Dates </li>
        <li> 1 1/2 cups Salted Butter </li>
        <li> 3 Tbspn Sugar </li>
        <li> 1 1/2 Tbspn Vanilla Extract </li>
        <li> 2 cups boiling water </li>
        </ul>

        <h4> CRUMB COAT </h4>
        <ul> 
        <li> 2 cups Rolled Oats </li>
        <li> 2 Tspn Baking Powder </li>
        <li> 1 cup Unsweetened Coconut Shredded or Flaked </li>
        <li> 2 cups Flour </li>
        <li> 1 Cup Brown Sugar</li>
        <li> 1 1/2 Cups Butter</li>
     </ul>

     <ol> 
        <li>In a saucepan, add the filling ingredients and bring to a low simmer. Simmer, stirring often, for about 20 minutes, or until the mixture becomes very thick. Watch the mixture carefully as it will burn easily in the last few minutes of cooking time. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li> In a large mixing bowl, add all of the crumb ingredients and use your hands to rub the butter into the dry ingredients. The mixture will form a crumbly topping. By this time, the date mixture is cooled, so preheat your oven to 350 degrees F and prepare a 9×13 inch baking dish by lining it with parchment paper.</li>   
        <li> Press half of the crumb topping into the prepared 9×13 baking dish. Press firmly to form a solid base for the date mixture. Pour the date mixture over top and spread it out evenly. Next, evenly distribute the remaining crumb mixture over top, pressing very lightly to push the crumb mixture gently into the date mixture. Bake for 40 minutes. Allow the Date Squares to cool completely before cutting </li>
