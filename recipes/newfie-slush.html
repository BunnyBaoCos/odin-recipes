    <h3> INSTRUCTIONS </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Pour water and white sugar into a large pot on high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce to low and simmer until sugar is dissolved and thickens ever-so-slightly, 3 to 5 min. Remove pot from heat.</li>
        <li>Once the mixture is cool, add lemonade and orange juice concentrate and pineapple juice and mix well until dissolved. Add rum.</li>
        <li>Transfer the mixture to a large, freezer-safe plastic container with a lid. (for authenticity use a salt beef container) </li>
        <li>Place mixture in the freezer, at least overnight, stirring periodically (every 12 hrs or so) to ensure it doesnâ€™t freeze solid, until the mixture is frozen into a slush.</li>
        <li>To serve: Spoon 2 scoops of slush with an ice cream scoop into a glass and top with soda. Garnish with a maraschino cherry. </li>    
    </ol>
